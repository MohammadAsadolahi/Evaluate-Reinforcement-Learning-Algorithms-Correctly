# Evaluate-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-Correctly
##This repo is under construction and its being updated every week!##  
A simpl but proper framework to accurately evaluate RL algorithms and fair comparison between different RL algorithms
unlike considering diffrences Reinforcement Learning has with other paradigms of machine learning (e.g. supervised learning, semi-supervised learning , unsupervised learning,...) , RL algorithms should be tested and evaluated in a specific framework that hold all necessary circumstances needed. in this repo with different examples we will try to make it clear how RL algorithms shuld be
